## homework3 Description
homework 3 is a class kaggle contest for twitter classification between
Donald.J.Trump and Hillary Clinton. We implenment one-hot vector,
word-embedding matrixs and LSTM-RNN model to classify tweets and use SVM classification model as baseline. 
## Mini-Project Description
this mini project compares three differents non-linear dimension reduction
methods, which are t-SNE, LargeVis and TriMap. The datasets we used is
Fashion-MNIST. We also use mean Precsion-Recall and Trustworthiness-Continuity
to analysis the quality of different methods.
