## 1. homework 3 Description
homework 3 is a class Kaggle contest for twitter classification between
Donald.J.Trump and Hillary Clinton. We implement one-hot vector,
word-embedding matrixes and LSTM-RNN model to classify tweets and use SVM classification model as baseline.

## 2. Mini-Project Description
this mini project compares three different non-linear dimension reduction
methods, which are [t-SNE](https://github.com/lvdmaaten/bhtsne), [LargerVis](https://github.com/lferry007/LargeVis) and [TriMap](https://github.com/eamid/trimap). The datasets we used is
Fashion-MNIST. We also use mean Precision-Recall and Trustworthiness-Continuity
to analysis the quality of different methods.
